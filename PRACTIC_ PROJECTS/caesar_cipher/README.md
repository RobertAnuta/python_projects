# Caesar Cipher


# Description

### In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

# Example 

### The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):

### Plain	A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
### Cipher	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W
### When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain" line and writes down the corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.

# How to run the script

## Using Python IDLE:
### If you have Python installed, it comes with an IDE called IDLE. You can open the main.py file by starting IDLE, clicking on "File" > "Open," and selecting your main.py file.

## Using the Command Line:
### Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory containing your main.py file using the "cd" command. Then, you can open it with Python by typing "python main.py."

# Utility

### You can encript or decript a message by following the instructions
### In this version the symbols/numbers/whitespaces are added at the same index without being changed
